cyborgs
=======
I will be making a mod for minecraft 1.7.10 with Forge 1179.
The mod code name is cyborgs as i don't have a name for it yet.
This is some of my idears for the mod

	each cyborg will be based off a vanilla minecraft mob.
		can add other mods mobs later.
	make them from a block.
	made for bones and iron.
		each bone is more like a skeleton of each mob for the cyborg.
		can make the bones in the minecraft armour that than can be made in to a full skeleton.
		
	What can thay do/have.
		be pets like wolfs and cat.
		modular upgrade.
		unique upgrades for the dierent minecraft mobs.

what can go bad.
	there will be a chace for the cyborg to go berserk.
	
i will be adding more in to the mod but i want to get this down 1st.i have more pland for it but is was 

I am not to good at code because i can not spell because of dyslexia but will try my best.
